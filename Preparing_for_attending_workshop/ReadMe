Before attending the workshop, please have the following ready.

1. Please bring a laptop for the hands-on analyses.
   Please make sure that the available hard disk space is at least 50 GB since it is required for the iCAMP analysis.
   Please check how many cores are available for your laptop.
   for Windows users, press Ctrl+Shift+ESC to open the task manager (작업관리자) and go to the Performance (성능) tab. Then, you can check the number of cores on your desktop or laptop.

2. Install required software
   2-1. R and R studio by referring to the links below

   2-2. Install required R packages
     - Session 2
       if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
       install.packages("BiocManager")
       BiocManager::install("genefilter")
       packages <- c("phyloseq", "vegan", "ggplot2", "lawstat", "FSA", "rcompanion", "remotes")
       install_packages <- packages[!sapply(packages, requireNamespace, quietly = TRUE)]
       if (length(install_packages) > 0) {
       install.packages(install_packages)
       }
       remotes::install_github("twbattaglia/btools")

       if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){install.packages("devtools")}
       devtools::install_github("jbisanz/qiime2R")


     - Session 3
       install.packages(c("iCAMP","reshape2","dplyr","ape"))

       # Please check if the packages are installed correctly by loading the packages in the R Studio.
       library(iCAMP)
       library(reshape2)
       library(dplyr)
       library(ape)

##### Caveats when installing R and R packages #####
1. Before installing R and R Studio, you should make sure below.
 - Check if your device name is in English.
 - Check if the user name is also in English.
 - Check if the directory path and folder names where R and R studio will be installed are in English.
   (Example path: C:\Program Files\R, works fine; C:\Users\GildongHong\Desktop\R, works fine; 
                  C:\Users\홍길동\Desktop\R, an error occurred because of the username; 
                  C:\Users\GildongHong\Desktop\R스튜디오, an error occurred because of the folder name)

2. While you install R packages using the above codes, you might see the message below.

"Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:"

When you get this message, type n and press the enter key to skip the update of the listed R packages.
(The package update could cause the malfunction of other R packages because of the loss of the dependency.)
