##### Caveats when installing R and R packages #####
1. Before installing R and R Studio, you should make sure below.
 - Check if your device name is in English.
 - Check if the user name is also in English.
 - Check if the directory path and folder names where R and R studio will be installed are in English.
   (Example path: C:\Program Files\R, works fine; C:\Users\GildongHong\Desktop\R, works fine; 
                  C:\Users\홍길동\Desktop\R, an error occurred because of the username; 
                  C:\Users\GildongHong\Desktop\R스튜디오, an error occurred because of the folder name)

2. While you install R packages using the above codes, you might see the message below.

"Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:"

When you get this message, type n and press the enter key to skip the update of the listed R packages.
(The package update could cause the malfunction of other R packages because of the loss of the dependency.)
