The files included in this directory are the bacterial amplicon sequence data sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform.
The V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes was amplified using the 515f/806r primer set.
The information on the primer sequences is available in Supplementary Table S1 of the paper by Kim et al., 2023. Phytobiomes J. (https://doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-10-22-0068-R).
